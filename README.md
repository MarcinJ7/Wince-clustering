# Wince-clustering

The objective of this analysis was to conduct clustering of wines, which involves grouping wines based on their physical and chemical features. This process aimed to find natural groups (clusters) of wines that exhibit similar properties. Clustering wines can help in understanding the differences between various types of wines and identifying similarities between them.
